This project showcases a dot spinner loader animation using HTML and CSS.

## Preview

The loader consists of 8 dots arranged in a circular pattern. Each dot animates in sequence, creating a smooth pulse effect.

## Files

- `index.html`: The structure of the loader.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS code to create the spinner animation.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file defines the loader using a series of div elements with the class `dot-spinner` and `dot-spinner__dot`.
2. **CSS Animation**: The CSS uses `@keyframes` to animate the dots with a pulsing effect. Each dot rotates and animates at different speeds for a smooth circular effect.

## Customization

- **Color**: Change the spinner color by modifying the `--uib-color` variable in the `.dot-spinner` class.
- **Size**: Adjust the size of the loader by changing the `--uib-size` variable.

```css
--uib-size: 2.8rem;
--uib-color: #183153;
